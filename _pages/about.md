I am a postdoctoral researcher at Université Paris-Saclay and INRIA Saclay, within the TAU Team. 
My current reserch focuses on causal structure learning. 
I obtained my PhD in May 2021 at Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, under the supervision of Pierre-Antoine Absil and Kyle A. Gallivan. I worked on matrix and tensor completion, graph-based machine learning, and optimization on matrix manifolds.
